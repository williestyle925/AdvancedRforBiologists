# Advanced R for Biologists

Welcome to *Advanced R for Biologists*!

This repository contains all important information about the *Advanced R for Biologists* course.

The course treats the application of R programming to different areas of bioinformatics and biostatistics. To a large extent we will use the textbook [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology" by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber](https://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/index.html) (MSMB) as a guide. 

## Logistics  

- Instructors: Clemens Kreutz, Martin Treppner, Eva Brombacher, Eva Kohnert
