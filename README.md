# Advanced R for Biologists

Welcome to Advanced R for biologists!

This repository contains all important information about the Advanced R for Biologists course.

The course treats the application of R programming to different areas of bioinformatics and biostatistics. To a large extent we will use the textbook "Modern Statistics for Modern Biology" by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber as a guide.
