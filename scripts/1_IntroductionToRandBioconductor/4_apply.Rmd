## apply examples:

```{r}
L <- list(a=1:2, b=2:4) 
L
lapply(L, mean) 
sapply(L, mean)  # returns an array or a matrix if appropriate

M <- matrix(1:20,nrow=5)
M
apply(M, 1, length)  # length applied along 1st dim
apply(M, 2, length)  # length applied along 1st dim 
apply(M, 1, sum)     # helpful for means, sums, ...
apply(M, 2, mean)    # helpful for means, sums, ...
```

## apply and own functions
```{r}
L
sapply(L, function(x) x*2)
sapply(L, function(x){if(max(x)>3)x else x*2 })
```
