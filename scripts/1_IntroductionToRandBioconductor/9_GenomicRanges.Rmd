```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(GenomicRanges)
```

```{r}
gr <- GRanges(
    seqnames = Rle(c("chr1", "chr2", "chr1", "chr3"), c(1, 3, 2, 4)),
    ranges = IRanges(101:110, end = 111:120, names = head(letters, 10)),
    strand = Rle(strand(c("-", "+", "*", "+", "-")), c(1, 2, 2, 3, 2)),
    score = 1:10,
    GC = seq(1, 0, length=10))
gr
```

Look inside a GRanges object:
```{r}
str(gr)
```
